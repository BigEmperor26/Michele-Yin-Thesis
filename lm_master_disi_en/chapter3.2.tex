\section{Crowdsourcing}
In order to complete the corpus, we required human sourced elicitations for continuations of the personal narratives presented in the dataset. We decided to exploit crowdsourcing, designing an experimental setup to instruct crowdworkers on how to induce the continuation of the narrative. This is followed by the data collection and an statistical analysis of the crowdsourced eliting questions.
% This section reports a concise overview of the experimental setup for crowdsourcing.
%  This section is comprised of:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Guidelines design}: Drafting guidelines tailored for the crowdsourcing component of the study and iteratively reviewing them until satisfactory.
%     \item \textbf{User Interface (UI) Design for Crowdsourcing}: Creation of a user-friendly interface incorporating the guidelines previously drafted, ensuring a seamless user experience.
%     \item \textbf{Data collection}: Engaging crowdworkers to participate in the data collection process and collection of responses to our narrative prompts.
%     \item \textbf{Data analysis}: A comprehensive data analysis on the participants' eliciting questions was conducted.
% \end{itemize}
\subsection{Guidelines design}
The formulation of effective guidelines was a fundamental requirement. This step necessitated an iterative process involving the creation of drafts, subsequent reviews, and pilot tests of guidelines. Pilot test were used to gauge the effectiveness of the guidelines in directing workers to generating correct eliciting questions for the continuation of personal narratives. This iterative cycle was repeated until the guidelines reached a level of satisfaction.

\input{assets/table/dataset-coadapt-highlight-examples}
After finalising the guidelines, the next step involved translating them into a custom web-based user interface (UI) for the data collection process. One key aspect of our guidelines was the inclusion of the valence values from the CoAdapt dataset. 
As previously mentioned, effective elicitation requires empathy, particularly for sorrowful events. In order to facilitate the crowdworkers in pivoting their questions to emotionally charged events, the valence values were highlighted in the text, with the recommendation to focus on those parts of the narrative. In order to represent effectively to the crowdworkers the positive and negative emotions expressed by the valence, it was decided to highlight negative valences in red and positive valences in green. An illustrative example can be seen in Table \ref{tab:dataset-coadapt-highlight-examples}. These colours were chosen as it is universally accepted that green stands for positive and red for negative. Furthermore, to limit the crowdworkers' cognitive workload, the ECs have not been added.
\input{assets/table/dataset-crowdsourcing-guidelines-properties}
This task places a large emphasis on the examples included in the guidelines because, during a pilot test, it was found that many crowdworkers try to complete the task as quickly as possible, giving only a light read to the guidelines and skipping directly to the examples. 
\input{assets/table/dataset-crowdsourcing-guidelines}
Table \ref{tab:dataset-crowdsourcing-guidelines} reports examples of good and bad elicitating questions for a given narrative that were given to the crowdworkers. 
%Initially, the examples provided were found to be ineffective, as they did not highlight the common issues faced by the crowdworkers. Therefore, after some internal testing, better examples that guide the crowdworkers through typical caveats of the task were devised.

% The main purpose of these guidelines was to help workers in producing a good elicitation. Our goals were for the elicitation to be questions with the following properties:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Focused on events of the narrative.
%     \item Suggested, but not enforced, focused on the highlighted portions of the narratives, i.e. parts of the narratives with valence.
%     \item Containing feedback signals, such as \emph{``Capisco"} or \emph{``Oh, che bello"} and other signs of active listening.
%     \item Centered around the narrator, i.e. should not move away from the narrator, the focus of the story.
%     \item Containing explicit references to events that happened in the narrative.
%     \item Showing empathy to the narrator, for instance, with words as \emph{``Mi dispiace"} when sad events are mentioned.
%     \item Short and on point.
%     \item Correct, both grammatically and syntactically.
% \end{itemize}
% On the other hand, we explicitly required our elicitation not to be any of the following:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Questions on personal opinions.
%     \item Suggestions.
%     \item Hypothetical questions or scenarios.
%     \item Questions that move the focus of the conversation away from the narrator.
% \end{itemize}
A brief recap of the desired properties of the eliciting questions is reported in Table \ref{tab:dataset-crowdsourcing-guidelines-properties}.
The table reports a few scenarios, such as requests for personal opinions or hypothetical conditions, which should be avoided because, in the internal testing, it was found that those types of questions may induce the narrator to start a new narrative with a different set of events. This is not desirable as the goal of those eliciting questions is to explore the current narrative and not to start a new one.
% Those examples were part of the guidelines that were given to the crowdworkers.
\subsection{User Interface (UI) Design for Crowdsourcing}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets//imgs/UI-examples-completed-1.png}
    \caption{Image of the Web UI that was shown to the crowdworkers as training examples. After each user inputs an answer, an example of a correct answer this the motivation was shown to train the crowdworkers against typical mistakes.}

    \caption{Image of the Web UI that was shown to the crowdworkers for the actual data collection process.}
    \label{fig:data_collection_web:4}
\end{figure}

For the UI, the selection of the design framework was founded upon Bootstrap \cite{bootstrap}. Bootstrap was chosen due to its user-friendly nature, ease of development, and contemporary design elements. Testing was conducted on multiple platforms, encompassing mobile devices, various web browsers, and distinct operating systems to ensure optimal user experience across diverse devices.
A few pages of the UI are reported. In Figure \ref{fig:data_collection_web:1} is shown the UI used to convey the guidelines, in Figure \ref{fig:data_collection_web:2} and \ref{fig:data_collection_web:3} are shown the examples that were used as training examples for the users. Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:data_collection_web:4} is reported the UI used for the actual data collection.

The colours used in the palette are material \cite{material}, with modern rounded corners and no sharp edges, keeping the design as minimal as possible. Colours for the highlighted text are a pale shade of red and green, \# F77A7B (\redbg{\hspace{1em}}) and \# 9AF288 (\greenbg{\hspace{1em}}). These colours were chosen due to their light tint and their high contrast on black text, allowing the text underneath the highlighted selection to be easily read.


\subsection{Data Collection}
\label{cha:methodology-data-collection}
Subsequently, upon the successful completion of the user interface, the data collection phase was initiated. Prolific, a reputable platform \cite{prolific} for data collection, was employed for this purpose. From this platform, only native Italian speakers were selected as eligible to undertake the task, due to the fact that our corpus is written in the Italian language.

The data collection process started with an initial pilot test, verifying accuracy and identifying any potential procedural errors. Once those were fixed, the data collection was started. The data collection was conducted in multiple batches, remunerating participants at a rate of Â£12 per hour. To prevent participant fatigue, each batch included a range from 5 to 8 narratives, with an estimated completion time of approximately 20 minutes per batch. In order to give roughly the same amount of load to each worker, a stratified sampling approach was used on the narrative lengths, giving each worker a similar amount of words to read. At the same time, to ensure consistency and elicit agreement among narrators, the first narrative for each batch across a set of batches was intentionally kept identical for different annotators. This first narrative was also shorter in length compared to subsequent narratives. This approach was employed for the dual purpose of manually verifying consensus among narrators regarding their elicitation topics on the same narrative and also serve as a warm-up exercise for the crowdworkers. This meant that there were a few narratives with multiple eliciting questions.

Following each run, each eliciting question was individually inspected and proofread in order to reject any unreliable data, resulting in the exclusion of only one set of answers.

% In total, a sum of $\sim$ Â£400 was disbursed as compensation for participant contributions.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
\label{cha:methodology-crowdsourcing-data-analysis}

\input{assets/table/dataset-data-collection-statistics}
A comprehensive analysis of the eliciting questions was undertaken following the data collection phase. In total, 594 narrative eliciting questions were collected. Using Spacy, the eliciting questions dataset is composed of 1110 unique words. On average, each response contained 11.8 tokens, with a standard deviation of 6.4. Overall, the average time required to complete the whole task was found to be 1143 seconds, which is slightly below the estimated time of 1200 seconds. This confirms a correct, and fair time estimate and, therefore, retribution. In Table \ref{tab:dataset-data-collection-statistics} are reported the summary of statistics computed. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets//imgs/dataset-top-30-answers.png}
    \caption{Bar chart showing the top 30 most frequent tokens present in the crowdsourced eliciting questions. Notice how tokens such as \emph{``dispiace"} are very common. This aligns with our guidelines of showing empathy for sad narratives. }
    \label{fig:dataset-top-30-answers}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:dataset-top-30-answers}, a bar chart representing the top 30 most frequent tokens from the collected eliciting questions are shown. The most prevalent token is \emph{``dispiace"}, which occurs disproportionately frequently with respect to the other tokens. This observation aligns coherently with the guidelines, which emphasise the importance of conveying empathy, especially for narratives of a sorrowful nature, which constitute the majority of the dataset.

Additionally, an analysis of the time employed by the crowdworkers to complete the task and the length of their assigned narratives was done. Initially, our hypothesis posited a strong correlation between the length of a narrative and the corresponding time required for writing an eliciting question to continue the narrative. We anticipated that users would invest more time comprehending the provided information, resulting in increased time spent on each narrative continuation eliciting question.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets//imgs/dataset-pearson-correlation.png}
    \caption{Image showing the plot of the correlation between lengths of the narratives (x-axis) and the corresponding time required to elicit (y-axis). For most narratives, the narrative length does not influence the completion time, as the bulk of the response times are under 200s regarless of narrative length. Response time is the time from when the narrative is shown to the user to them sending the answer. }
    \label{fig:dataset-pearson-correlation}
\end{figure}
% \begin{figure}[!htbp]
%     \centering
%         \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets//imgs/dataset-overall-correlation-workers.png}
%         \caption{In Figure is shown the correlation between lengths of the narratives (x-axis) and the corresponding time required to elicit (y-axis). It is possible to notice that most annotators are able to complete each task within 200 seconds, regardless of the narrative length.}
%         \label{fig:dataset-overall-correlation-workers}
% \end{figure}
However, it was found that this is not to be the case, as pictured in Figure \ref{fig:dataset-pearson-correlation}. To provide a more precise quantification of this observation, the Pearson correlation coefficient \cite{pearson} was computed between the completion times for each narrative and the respective narrative lengths. The resulting overall correlation coefficient was found to be 0.16, further supporting the notion that completion times and narrative lengths do not exhibit a linear relationship. This is likely the result of the human annotators spending time carefully considering their proposed questions after reading the narrative rather than simply reading the narrative and immediately responding. This is further supported by the fact that the majority of the crowdworkers completed the task within 200 seconds, regardless of the narrative length.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets//imgs/dataset-high-correlation-workers.png}
        \caption{Image reporting the correlation between lengths of the narratives (x-axis) and the corresponding time required to elicit (y-axis) for 5 workers in particular. For these 5 annotators, there is a high degree of linear correlation between the narrative length and the time required for completion.}
        \label{fig:dataset-high-correlation-workers}
\end{figure}
Nevertheless, although this result is true on the whole dataset and for most crowdworkers, it is important to note that a few outliers were encountered. These crowdworkers exhibited a notably strong correlation. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:dataset-high-correlation-workers}, these specific users displayed a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.90. We attribute this phenomenon to the exceptional speed with which these users crafted their responses, which in turn placed a significant emphasis on the reading time as the dominant factor in their overall response time.

\input{assets/table/personal-narrative-elicitation-continuations-examples}
A brief reading of the eliciting questions for a few examples of narratives revealed that most of the annotators propose the same inquiries or topics for short narratives. An example is shown in Table \ref{tab:personal-narrative-elicitation-continuations-example}. We believe this fact is the result of a narrative not having more than one or a few natural directions.% This fact will play an important role in the evaluation of LLMs later in chapter 4.
