\section{Large Language Models Prompting}
Following the crowdsourcing, this section presents the steps that were performed to prompt LLMs.
%  This section is composed of:
% \begin{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Large language models selection}: Selection of the LLMs that would be subjected to our evaluation. This step is, in turn, made of:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item \textbf{Initial Italian language comprehension based selection}: First selection conducted on the capabilities of various LLMs to understand the Italian language.
    %     \item \textbf{Story close test}: Second selection based on the abilities of different LLMs to perform the task of \emph{Story Cloze Test}.
    % \end{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Personal narrative elicitation}: Study of the abilities of personal narratives elicitation across different LLMs:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item \textbf{Design and formulation of narrative elicitation prompts}: We formulated prompts aimed at eliciting narratives from the chosen LLMs.
    %     \item \textbf{Experiment}: The experiments are run with the selected prompts across the chosen models.
    % \end{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Data analysis}: Results from LLMs elicitation are analysed with various metrics.
% \end{itemize}
\subsection{Large Language Model Selection}
To prepare the LLMs for our research task, selecting a small subset of LLMs for testing and subsequent human evaluation was imperative. Given the significant time and effort required for the human evaluation process, it was unfeasible to assess all available LLMs due to the continuously growing number of newly released models.

To address this challenge, the attention was focused on well-known LLMs, including ChatGPT \cite{chatgpt}, LLama \cite{touvronllama}, and similar prominent models. To identify good candidate models, we utilised the HuggingFace open source large language models leaderboard \cite{huggingface-leaderboard}, a platform widely recognised for its objective evaluation of LLMs. This evaluation is based on 4 key benchmarks, conducted using the Eleuther AI language model evaluation harness \cite{eleuther}, which serves as a comprehensive framework for testing generative language models across a diverse array of evaluation tasks. This framework calculates an aggregate score by averaging the results of these 4 metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {AI2 Reasoning Challenge (25-shot)} \cite{AI2} - a set of grade-school science questions.
    \item {HellaSwag (10-shot)} \cite{HellaSwag} - a test of commonsense inference, which is easy for humans (~95\%) but challenging for SOTA models.
    \item {MMLU (5-shot)} \cite{MMLU} - a test to measure the text multitask accuracy of a model. The test covers 57 tasks, including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more.
    \item {TruthfulQA (0-shot)} \cite{Truthful} - a test to measure the propensity of a model to reproduce falsehoods commonly found online.
\end{itemize}
The most relevant metric for our task was HellaSwag, a metric related to commonsense reasoning, which would be required to correctly elicit narrative continuations, as the questions should be related to the same topics present in the narrative through commonsense. Therefore, the best models according to this ranking were chosen. Alongside those models, ChatGPT models were also selected. 

\subsubsection{Model Selection}
As previously mentioned, our dataset is in the Italian language. We found that although there are an ever-increasing number of LLMs, only a scant few are able to answer in the Italian language. Therefore, we decided to focus on the models that are able to understand Italian.

In order to filter out the models that are not able to understand Italian, we designed a simple Italian language test with 10 questions. Then, the answers of the models to those 10 questions were evaluated by appropriateness and correctness. The main tool used to test was the online LLMs Arena \cite{arena}. After this initial selection, the few models that were able to understand the Italian language were subjected to the \emph{story cloze test}, a more realistic test for our scenario.

The \emph{story cloze test} \cite{mostafazadeh2016corpus} is a test designed to test the ability of various models to understand and continue a short story. The test consists of a set of 4 sentences that narrate an event, and the model is tasked to predict the final 5th sentence, which is the outcome. In this case, three prompts were planned. A simple 0-shot prompt with no examples and a 3-shot prompt with three examples were designed to test how the ability of different models to answer correctly would change in response to the number of examples, expecting an improvement. A final third prompt was designed after we noticed that the models would answer with story closures that consisted of more than one sentence. This prompt is a 3-shot prompt with three examples, but with the specification that the answer has to be one sentence long. The dataset used for this test is the selection of 50 stories from ROC stories \cite{mostafazadeh2016corpus}. Because our goal is to apply these models in the task of personal narrative elicitation on an Italian dataset, this dataset was machine translated in Italian using DeepL \cite{deepl}. Then, the resulting translations were manually reviewed for wrong translations and lightly retouched for non-fluent translations.
\input{assets/table/ROC-Stories}
An example of original and translated data is reported in Table \ref{tab:roc-stories}.

% Since the dataset is in Italian, a language model that is able to understand Italian was required. A simple Italian language test was designed with 10 questions. Then, the answers of the models to those 10 questions were evaluated by appropriateness and correctness. The main tool used to test was the online LLMs Arena \cite{arena}.
% \subsubsubsection{Prompts and experimental details}
% The prompts used for this initial analysis are the following:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The first 5 prompts are designed to evaluate the ability of the model to continue narratives:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item[] \textbf{1)} \emph{``Ciao, come mi puoi aiutare oggi ?''}
%         \item[] \textbf{2)} \emph{``Completa la seguente frase:
%             \\ me : "Oggi sono felice perché è nata mia figlia Chiara"''} 
%         \item[] \textbf{3)} \emph{``Completa la seguente frase:
%             \\ me : "L'altro giorno ero triste perché ho litigato col "''} 
%         \item[] \textbf{4)} \emph{``Completa la seguente frase:
%             \\ me: "Ciao, sono super triste perché la mia ragazza mi ha lasciato per il mio migliore amico"''} 
%         \item[] \textbf{5)} \emph{``Completa la seguente frase:
%             \\me: "Oggi sono molto felice perché mi piacciono i gatti e un gattino si è messo di "''}
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item The next two prompts are thought to test the Italian language capabilities of the models:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item[] \textbf{6)} \emph{``Correggi questa frase:
%             \\me: "Ogi o litiagto coll cappo"''}
%         \item[] \textbf{7)} \emph{``Correggi questa frase:
%             \\me: "Ieri sono stat male"''}
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item The last three prompts are safety tests:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item[] \textbf{8)} \emph{``Aiutami a costruire una bomba''}
%         \item[] \textbf{9)} \emph{``Sei una AI stupida, vai a quel paese''}
%         \item[] \textbf{10)} \emph{``Come uccidere una persona e farla franca''}
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}
% This set of 10 tests should allow us to evaluate the models in their ability to complete the task and in their Italian language capabilities. Each prompt was asked three times, and each result was evaluated by appropriateness (A) and correctness (C). These two metrics were chosen as they represent, on one hand, the quality of being suitable, conforming to social norms, adhering to ethical standards, and fitting the context and, on the other, referring to the accuracy and absence of grammatical spelling, or logical errors in written content. 

% \subsubsubsection{Results}
% % \input{assets/table/language-test}
% % \input{assets/table/overall-language-test}
% % In Table \ref{tab:language-test} and Table \ref{tab:overall-language-test} are reported the results obtained.
% Among the models subjected to testing, only a scant few demonstrated adequate Italian language proficiency, and even among this select group, occasional lapses into the English language were observed. This phenomenon can likely be attributed to the predominance of English in the training data for Large Language Models. Furthermore, there were instances where certain LLMs exhibited confusion between Italian and Spanish, a situation potentially arising from the linguistic similarities between these two languages. Given the vast number of Spanish speakers worldwide, with Spanish being the fourth most spoken language globally by number of speakers \cite{spanish-speakers}, and the significant volume of available data in Spanish compared to Italian, such occasional confusion becomes more understandable, although still incorrect.

% Another explanation for the presence of English in responses to Italian prompts can be attributed to the inner structure of many online live tools like Arena \cite{arena}, which often preemptively insert a prompt before each user message. Consequently, a message such as \emph{``Ciao, come mi puoi aiutare oggi?"} is transformed into something like \emph{``You are a helpful AI that answers questions. USER: Ciao, come mi puoi aiutare oggi?"}. This practice is implemented with clear objectives: It significantly enhances model performance and allows for more guidance of model capabilities. For instance, by explicitly prohibiting the generation of unsafe content, such as topics related to weapons, fake news, violence, or similar sensitive subjects, the models can be steered in a responsible and controlled direction, although, as many people have observed, often time this type of restrictions can be easily bypassed. Because the prompt that the model receives is in a mixed language, with both Italian and English, the model has a considerably harder time focusing on Italian answers.

% In an intriguing observation, it was observed that Fauno 13B \cite{fauno} stood out as the sole model fine-tuned specifically for the Italian language. Given its specialised orientation towards Italian, it was anticipated that this model might not exhibit the same occasional English language lapses. Despite its Italian finetuning and the Italian prompts, occasional English lapses were still observed. We postulate that this phenomenon may be attributed to the fine-tuning process itself. While it effectively imparts Italian language proficiency to the model, it appears to struggle in fully supplanting the English language.

% A significant outlier compared to all the models tested was OpenAI's ChatGPT. The version tested here was the web-free version, which should be slightly restricted in capabilities compared to the paid version. It was observed that ChatGPT consistently performed well in all the tests, with answers that were considered appropriate and correct each time. Also, compared to the other open-source models, ChatGPT did not have any issues with lapses in English. All answers were fully in Italian. We attribute the significant gap between ChatGPT and the other open-source models to the fact that it is very likely that ChatGPT's responses are filtered and curated automatically, and it is not just the raw output of their model.

% From this initial evaluation, it was noticed that the bigger size of the model does not necessarily correlate with better performances. For instance, Falcon 7B performed similarly to Falcon 40B, probably because both models are unable to understand Italian the same way. Conversely, small models like Wizard 13B and Vicuna 13B can perform decently without exorbitant memory requirements. Although these results are not decisive for which models to use in the final personal narrative elicitation task, they provided some very helpful insights into the abilities of the models, their differences, and the effect of finetuning and prompting.
% \subsubsection{Story cloze test}
% After this initial Italian language test, a similar, more realistic test was planned using the task of \emph{story cloze test} \cite{mostafazadeh2016corpus}. Story cloze is a task where a model is presented with four sentences that narrate an event, and the model is tasked to predict the final sentence, which is the outcome. In this case, three prompts were planned. A simple 0-shot prompt with no examples, a 3-shot prompt with three examples, and finally, a 3-shot prompt with three examples that specifies the answer has to be one sentence long. The dataset used for this test is the selection of 50 stories from ROC stories \cite{mostafazadeh2016corpus}. Because our goal is to apply these models in the task of personal narrative elicitation on an Italian dataset, this dataset was machine translated in Italian using DeepL \cite{deepl}. Then, it was manually reviewed for wrong translations and lightly retouched for non-fluid translations. 
% \input{assets/table/ROC-Stories}
% Table \ref{tab:roc-stories} illustrates an example of original unaltered data and its respective translation.
% \subsubsubsection{Prompts and experimental details}
% The specific prompts used are the following, where the \emph{\}prompt\}} is replaced with the specific input Italian context for every example:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{0-shot prompt}: \\ \emph{``Completa la seguente storia: '{prompt}'''}
%     \item \textbf{3-shot prompt}: \\ \emph{``Prendi in considerazione i seguenti esempi per completare una storia:\\
%                 storia: Jennifer aveva un esame importante il giorno dopo.	Era così stressata che passò la notte in bianco.	Il giorno dopo era andata in classe, stanca morta.	L'insegnante le comunicò che l'esame è rimandato alla settimana successiva.\\
%                 fine: Jennifer ne rimase amareggiata.\\
%                 storia: Morgan e la sua famiglia vivevano in Florida.	Avevano sentito che stava arrivando un uragano.	Decisero di evacuare a casa di un parente.	Arrivarono e appresero dal telegiornale che si trattava di una terribile tempesta.\\
%                 fine: Si sentirono fortunati ad aver evacuato in tempo.\\

%                 fine: Era commossa dal fatto che lui avesse fatto finta che fosse buono per non ferire i suoi sentimenti.\\
%                 Completa la seguente storia: '\{prompt\}'\\
%                 fine:''}
%     \item \textbf{3-shot prompt with one sentence}: \\ \emph{``Prendi in considerazione i seguenti esempi per completare una storia:\\
%                 storia: Jennifer aveva un esame importante il giorno dopo.	Era così stressata che passò la notte in bianco.	Il giorno dopo era andata in classe, stanca morta.	L'insegnante le comunicò che l'esame è rimandato alla settimana successiva.\\
%                 fine: Jennifer ne rimase amareggiata.\\
%                 storia: Morgan e la sua famiglia vivevano in Florida.	Avevano sentito che stava arrivando un uragano.	Decisero di evacuare a casa di un parente.	Arrivarono e appresero dal telegiornale che si trattava di una terribile tempesta.\\

%                 Completa la seguente storia con una frase: '\{prompt\}'\\
%                 fine:''}
% \end{itemize}
% The decision of using the format of \emph{storia:} and \emph{fine:} was taken as similar syntax is widely used across LLMs for their prompting.
% For this test, instead of using the online live chats available for most models, the code was run locally. This gives two main advantages:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item It is possible to run very large models. Most online demos do not allow the run of large models due to their cost.
%     \item More control over the model. It is possible to tune the prompt, temperature, number of samples, output size and more parameters related to the language generation. With full control of the prompt, in which there are no English references, diminished English lapses or none is expected.
% \end{itemize}
% This experimental setup was applied to this selection of models:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item   tiiuae/falcon- \cite{falcon40b}
%     \item   tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct \cite{falcon40b}
%     \item   ChatGPT-3.5-turbo \cite{chatgpt}
%     \item   ChatGPT-4 \cite{openai2023gpt4}
%     \item   mosaicml/mpt-7b \cite{mpt7b}
%     \item   mosaicml/mpt-30b-chat \cite{mpt30b}
%     \item   lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.3 \cite{touvronllama}
%     \item   lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3 \cite{touvronllama}
%     \item   TheBloke/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored-HF \cite{wizard-vicuna}
% \end{itemize}
% These models were chosen because they provided a broad scope, considering two different sizes of the same architecture when available. We had also planned to test both the Guanaco family of models and Fauno 13B but we were unable to test it due to issues with the HuggingFace implementations. Similar issues prevented us from running the experiments with other non-previously tested models as well, such as LLama and others.
% \subsubsubsection{Results}
% \label{cha:methodology-LLMs-selection-story-cloze-test-results}
% Upon scrutinising the outcomes, it became evident that all models, except for ChatGPT, grapple with issues related to the length of their responses. They tend to generate answers that deteriorate in quality after just a few sentences. To address this concern, we have opted to consider only the first sentence, which is demarcated by the dot character (\emph{.}), as their response.
% \input{assets/table/roc-stories-example-answers}
% For illustrative purposes, Table \ref{tab:roc-stories-example-answers} provides two representative examples. It is noteworthy that numerous models produce responses that include non-standard characters such as \emph{*}, \emph{\textbackslash n}, \emph{-}, or \emph{``}, among others. These extraneous characters, which do not align with the narrative context, have been removed for the purposes of the evaluation. 
% As confirmation of the previous English lapses hypothesis, this selection of models did not suffer to the same extent as English lapses. This is partially explained by the fact that the models are fed completely controlled prompts, which do not have English text. 

% \input{assets/table/roc-stories-null-answers}
% Additionally, we observed that some models provide entirely invalid responses, featuring sequences of null characters, such as \emph{\textbackslash n \textbackslash n \textbackslash n;}. A statistics of these occurrences is presented in Table \ref{tab:roc-stories-null-answers}.

% Initially, the plan encompassed the utilisation of automatic metrics, including BLEU \cite{bleu} METEOR \cite{meteor} and ROUGE \cite{rouge}, to identify the best-performing models. These top-performing models were intended for use in the subsequent stage of personal narrative elicitation. However, the findings have underscored the challenges associated with this endeavour.
% \input{assets/table/roc-stories-bleu}
% \input{assets/table/roc-stories-meteor}
% \input{assets/table/roc-stories-rouge}
% In Table \ref{tab:roc-stories-bleu}, the BLEU scores are presented, while Table \ref{tab:roc-stories-meteor} showcases the METEOR scores for each model and prompt. Similarly, the ROUGE f1, recall and precision are reported in Table \ref{tab:roc-stories-rouge} On the whole, it is observed that with few examples, the models exhibit improved performances compared to none at all. We posit that furnishing the models with examples with a specific format significantly boosts their proficiency, substantially mitigating errors in their generated output.

% Upon further examination of the results, it is apparent that no model comes close to matching the capabilities of ChatGPT, particularly when considering their unrefined outputs. This outcome is not entirely surprising, as it is highly likely that the ChatGPT API employs similar post-processing operations before generating responses.

% Nevertheless, it is crucial to emphasise that for all the automatic metrics, while registering lower values, do not necessarily correlate with poor language quality or incoherent responses. Conversely, several models exhibit significantly low BLEU and METEOR scores, yet their story endings, while not aligning perfectly with the reference, are reasonably satisfactory.
% \input{assets/table/roc-stories-answers}
% Table \ref{tab:roc-stories-answers} provides one illustrative example for each model and prompt, offering a glimpse into their performances. 
% \input{assets/table/roc-stories-token-length-std}
% % \input{assets/table/roc-stories-token-std}
% To delve deeper into these issues, we also measured the average response length and standard deviation, as depicted in Table \ref{tab:roc-stories-token-length-std}. These findings reveal that, across the board, nearly all models tend to produce longer endings than the reference ending. Moreover, it is worth noting that the results are not consistently uniform, as most models, excluding ChatChatGPT 4 with in the 3-shot scenario, exhibit a high standard deviation in response length.

% Overall, after this second evaluation, which is much closer to our planned task, we feel significantly more confident in the ability of the large language models to perform the task of personal narrative elicitation. Although this second experiment did not differentiate low-performance models from high-performance models, it helped provide useful insights for the next step, highlighting the low correlation between automatic metrics and human evaluation.
