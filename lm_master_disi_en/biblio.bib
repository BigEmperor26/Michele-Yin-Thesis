 abstract = {In this paper I describe two contrasting classroom contexts for eliciting personal narratives, Drawing from a larger study in which I followed one second language learner as he proceeded through 2nd and 3rd grade, my analysis is based on reading group interactions video-recorded weekly during the second semester of each year. Comparison of oral narrative elicitation across years reveals two very different participation contexts. In one context narrative elicitation occurred primarily in two-person dialogue with the teacher. In another context oral narrative emerged through multi-party dialogue after the official lesson had closed. These contrasting contexts thus facilitated qualitatively different forms of co-tellership and as a consequence different opportunities for oral narrative. I intend this analysis of narrative elicitation to draw attention to the margins of classroom activity and by doing so to take a step toward a discourse-based solution to what has been recognized as a discourse-based problem in schools: differential access to oral preparation for literacy.},

    abstract = "Human Evaluation (HE) of automatically generated responses is necessary for the advancement of human-machine dialogue research. Current automatic evaluation measures are poor surrogates, at best. There are no agreed-upon HE protocols and it is difficult to develop them. As a result, researchers either perform non-replicable, non-transparent and inconsistent procedures or, worse, limit themselves to automated metrics. We propose to standardize the human evaluation of response generation models by publicly sharing a detailed protocol. The proposal includes the task design, annotators recruitment, task execution, and annotation reporting. Such protocol and process can be used as-is, as-a-whole, in-part, or modified and extended by the research community. We validate the protocol by evaluating two conversationally fine-tuned state-of-the-art models (GPT-2 and T5) for the complex task of personalized response generation. We invite the community to use this protocol - or its future community amended versions - as a transparent, replicable, and comparable approach to HE of generated responses.",

  abstract  = "AIM: This paper reviews literature on narrative analysis and
               illustrates the meaning-making function of stories of chronic
               illness through analysis and discussion of two case studies from
               a study of acute episodes of chronic obstructive pulmonary
               disease (COPD). BACKGROUND: Individuals living with COPD
               experience acute exacerbations characterized by extreme dyspnea,
               but there has been little research to provide understanding of
               these events from the perspectives of individuals with COPD,
               family caregivers, and nurses. Narrative analysis -- considered
               in the context of the aims of qualitative research --
               illuminates how these people make sense of acute exacerbation
               events by telling stories. DESIGN AND METHODS: In an
               ethnographic study, 10 patient-family nurse units in two
               Canadian general hospitals participated in interviews concerning
               acute episodes of COPD. Narrative analysis enabled
               identification of several story forms and their functions.
               RESULTS: Examples were found of a story told twice with
               different meanings, and of a patient's 'death story' used to
               communicate distrust of the nurse's ability to recognize the
               seriousness of distress and implications for its potential
               course. These examples are presented, and interpreted with
               respect to issues of meaning. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis
               indicates that stories told by patients in the context of
               nurse-client interactions inform understanding of the
               individual's acute exacerbation events beyond the biophysical.",

abstract="Background: While mental health applications are increasingly becoming available for large populations of users, there is a lack of controlled trials on the impacts of such applications. Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered agents have been evaluated when assisting adults with cognitive impairments; however, few applications are available for aging adults who are still actively working. These adults often have high stress levels related to changes in their work places, and related symptoms eventually affect their quality of life. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of TEO (Therapy Empowerment Opportunity), a mobile personal health care agent with conversational AI. TEO promotes mental health and well-being by engaging patients in conversations to recollect the details of events that increased their anxiety and by providing therapeutic exercises and suggestions. Methods: The study was based on a protocolized intervention for stress and anxiety management. Participants with stress symptoms and mild-to-moderate anxiety received an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered remotely. A group of participants also interacted with the agent TEO. The participants were active workers aged over 55 years. The experimental groups were as follows: group 1, traditional therapy; group 2, traditional therapy and mobile health (mHealth) agent; group 3, mHealth agent; and group 4, no treatment (assigned to a waiting list). Symptoms related to stress (anxiety, physical disease, and depression) were assessed prior to treatment (T1), at the end (T2), and 3 months after treatment (T3), using standardized psychological questionnaires. Moreover, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and General Anxiety Disorders-7 scales were administered before the intervention (T1), at mid-term (T2), at the end of the intervention (T3), and after 3 months (T4). At the end of the intervention, participants in groups 1, 2, and 3 filled in a satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Despite randomization, statistically significant differences between groups were present at T1. Group 4 showed lower levels of anxiety and depression compared with group 1, and lower levels of stress compared with group 2. Comparisons between groups at T2 and T3 did not show significant differences in outcomes. Analyses conducted within groups showed significant differences between times in group 2, with greater improvements in the levels of stress and scores related to overall well-being. A general worsening trend between T2 and T3 was detected in all groups, with a significant increase in stress levels in group 2. Group 2 reported higher levels of perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Conclusions: No statistically significant differences could be observed between participants who used the mHealth app alone or within the traditional CBT setting. However, the results indicated significant differences within the groups that received treatment and a stable tendency toward improvement, which was limited to individual perceptions of stress-related symptoms.
