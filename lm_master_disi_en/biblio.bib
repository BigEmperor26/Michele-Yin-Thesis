 abstract = {In this paper I describe two contrasting classroom contexts for eliciting personal narratives, Drawing from a larger study in which I followed one second language learner as he proceeded through 2nd and 3rd grade, my analysis is based on reading group interactions video-recorded weekly during the second semester of each year. Comparison of oral narrative elicitation across years reveals two very different participation contexts. In one context narrative elicitation occurred primarily in two-person dialogue with the teacher. In another context oral narrative emerged through multi-party dialogue after the official lesson had closed. These contrasting contexts thus facilitated qualitatively different forms of co-tellership and as a consequence different opportunities for oral narrative. I intend this analysis of narrative elicitation to draw attention to the margins of classroom activity and by doing so to take a step toward a discourse-based solution to what has been recognized as a discourse-based problem in schools: differential access to oral preparation for literacy.},

    abstract = "Human Evaluation (HE) of automatically generated responses is necessary for the advancement of human-machine dialogue research. Current automatic evaluation measures are poor surrogates, at best. There are no agreed-upon HE protocols and it is difficult to develop them. As a result, researchers either perform non-replicable, non-transparent and inconsistent procedures or, worse, limit themselves to automated metrics. We propose to standardize the human evaluation of response generation models by publicly sharing a detailed protocol. The proposal includes the task design, annotators recruitment, task execution, and annotation reporting. Such protocol and process can be used as-is, as-a-whole, in-part, or modified and extended by the research community. We validate the protocol by evaluating two conversationally fine-tuned state-of-the-art models (GPT-2 and T5) for the complex task of personalized response generation. We invite the community to use this protocol - or its future community amended versions - as a transparent, replicable, and comparable approach to HE of generated responses.",

To achieve this, NLP tasks are framed as natural language prompts, generating a response indicating the predicted output. Nonetheless, the performance in such settings often lags far behind its supervised counterpart, suggesting a large space for potential improvement. In this paper, we explore methods to utilize unlabeled data to improve zero-shot performance. Specifically, we take advantage of the fact that multiple prompts can be used to specify a single task, and propose to regularize prompt consistency, encouraging consistent predictions over this diverse set of prompts. Our method makes it possible to fine-tune the model either with extra unlabeled training data, or directly on test input at inference time in an unsupervised manner. In experiments, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot learner, T0, on 9 out of 11 datasets across 4 NLP tasks by up to 10.6 absolute points in terms of accuracy. The gains are often attained with a small number of unlabeled examples.",

  abstract  = "AIM: This paper reviews literature on narrative analysis and
               illustrates the meaning-making function of stories of chronic
               illness through analysis and discussion of two case studies from
               a study of acute episodes of chronic obstructive pulmonary
               disease (COPD). BACKGROUND: Individuals living with COPD
               experience acute exacerbations characterized by extreme dyspnea,
               but there has been little research to provide understanding of
               these events from the perspectives of individuals with COPD,
               family caregivers, and nurses. Narrative analysis -- considered
               in the context of the aims of qualitative research --
               illuminates how these people make sense of acute exacerbation
               events by telling stories. DESIGN AND METHODS: In an
               ethnographic study, 10 patient-family nurse units in two
               Canadian general hospitals participated in interviews concerning
               acute episodes of COPD. Narrative analysis enabled
               identification of several story forms and their functions.
               RESULTS: Examples were found of a story told twice with
               different meanings, and of a patient's 'death story' used to
               communicate distrust of the nurse's ability to recognize the
               seriousness of distress and implications for its potential
               course. These examples are presented, and interpreted with
               respect to issues of meaning. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis
               indicates that stories told by patients in the context of
               nurse-client interactions inform understanding of the
               individual's acute exacerbation events beyond the biophysical.",

@ARTICLE{Anderson2016-jq,
  title     = "Narrative interviewing",
  author    = "Anderson, Claire and Kirkpatrick, Susan",
  abstract  = "Introduction Narrative interviews place the people being
               interviewed at the heart of a research study. They are a means
               of collecting people's own stories about their experiences of
               health and illness. Narrative interviews can help researchers to
               better understand people's experiences and behaviours.
               Narratives may come closer to representing the context and
               integrity of people's lives than more quantitative means of
               research. Methodology Researchers using narrative interview
               techniques do not set out with a fixed agenda, rather they tend
               to let the interviewee control the direction, content and pace
               of the interview. The paper describes the interview process and
               the suggested approach to analysis of narrative interviews, We
               draw on the example from a study that used series of narrative
               interviews about people's experiences of taking antidepressants.
               Limitations Some people may find it particularly challenging to

abstract="Background: While mental health applications are increasingly becoming available for large populations of users, there is a lack of controlled trials on the impacts of such applications. Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered agents have been evaluated when assisting adults with cognitive impairments; however, few applications are available for aging adults who are still actively working. These adults often have high stress levels related to changes in their work places, and related symptoms eventually affect their quality of life. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of TEO (Therapy Empowerment Opportunity), a mobile personal health care agent with conversational AI. TEO promotes mental health and well-being by engaging patients in conversations to recollect the details of events that increased their anxiety and by providing therapeutic exercises and suggestions. Methods: The study was based on a protocolized intervention for stress and anxiety management. Participants with stress symptoms and mild-to-moderate anxiety received an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered remotely. A group of participants also interacted with the agent TEO. The participants were active workers aged over 55 years. The experimental groups were as follows: group 1, traditional therapy; group 2, traditional therapy and mobile health (mHealth) agent; group 3, mHealth agent; and group 4, no treatment (assigned to a waiting list). Symptoms related to stress (anxiety, physical disease, and depression) were assessed prior to treatment (T1), at the end (T2), and 3 months after treatment (T3), using standardized psychological questionnaires. Moreover, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and General Anxiety Disorders-7 scales were administered before the intervention (T1), at mid-term (T2), at the end of the intervention (T3), and after 3 months (T4). At the end of the intervention, participants in groups 1, 2, and 3 filled in a satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Despite randomization, statistically significant differences between groups were present at T1. Group 4 showed lower levels of anxiety and depression compared with group 1, and lower levels of stress compared with group 2. Comparisons between groups at T2 and T3 did not show significant differences in outcomes. Analyses conducted within groups showed significant differences between times in group 2, with greater improvements in the levels of stress and scores related to overall well-being. A general worsening trend between T2 and T3 was detected in all groups, with a significant increase in stress levels in group 2. Group 2 reported higher levels of perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Conclusions: No statistically significant differences could be observed between participants who used the mHealth app alone or within the traditional CBT setting. However, the results indicated significant differences within the groups that received treatment and a stable tendency toward improvement, which was limited to individual perceptions of stress-related symptoms.

  abstract  = "Purpose Creating more positive individual narratives around
               illness and identity is at the heart of the mental health care
               recovery movement. Some recovery services explicitly use
               personal storytelling as an intervention. The purpose of this
               paper is to look at individual experiences of a personal
               storytelling intervention, a recovery college Telling My Story
               (TMS) course. Design/methodology/approach Eight participants who
               had attended the TMS course offered at a UK recovery college
               were interviewed. Data were analysed using interpretative
               phenomenological analysis. Findings Five key themes, namely a
               highly emotional experience, feeling safe to disclose, renewed
               sense of self, two-way process and a novel opportunity, were
               emerged. Originality/value The findings suggest that
               storytelling can be a highly meaningful experience and an
               important part of the individual's recovery journey. They also
               begin to identify elements of the storytelling process which
               might aid recovery, and point to pragmatic setting conditions
               for storytelling interventions to be helpful. More time could be
               dedicated to individuals telling their story within UK mental
               health services, and the authors can use this insight into the
               experience of personal storytelling to guide any future

               research has to prioritize capturing this crucial component of
               real-world affect. Modeling dynamic emotional stimuli requires
               solving the twin challenges of time-series modeling and of
               collecting high-quality time-series datasets. We begin by
               assessing the state-of-the-art in time-series emotion
               recognition, and we review contemporary time-series approaches
               in affective computing, including discriminative and generative

               Emotional Narratives Dataset (SENDv1): a set of rich, multimodal
               videos of self-paced, unscripted emotional narratives, annotated
               for emotional valence over time. The complex narratives and
               naturalistic expressions in this dataset provide a challenging

In this paper, we present an improved state-of-the-art and comparatively evaluate BERT-based models for sentiment analysis on Italian corpora. The proposed model is evaluated over eight sentiment analysis corpora from different domains (social media, finance, e-commerce, health, travel) and sources (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, Tripadvisor, Opera and Personal Healthcare Agent) on the prediction of positive, negative and neutral classes. Our findings suggest that BERT-based models are confident in predicting positive and negative examples but not as much with neutral examples. We release the sentiment analysis model as well as a newly financial domain sentiment corpus.",

               research method that was developed by integrating elements from

               narrative interview draws on critically oriented theoretical
               foundations and principles of experience-centered narrative and
               includes features from narrative inquiry, semistructured
               interview, and episodic interview. The purpose of episodic
               narrative interview is to better understand a phenomenon by
               generating individual stories of experience about that
               phenomenon. As such, an episodic narrative interview participant
               provides nested narrative accounts of their experiences with a
               social phenomenon, within the context of a bounded situation or
               episode. In this article, the author details the foundations of

               professions. En route, I introduce the distinction between true
               and real stories, discuss the importance of hypothetical stories
               in modern moral philosophy and show how storytelling can
               contribute to the development of thinking about practice. I also
               offer reasons for my view that empathy is central to skilled and
               ethical caring and touch on some ethical issues, including the
               apparent seriousness with which the value of confidentiality is
               upheld within the caring professions.",
