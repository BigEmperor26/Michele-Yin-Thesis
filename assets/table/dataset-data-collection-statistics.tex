\caption{Table reporting the statistics computed from the crowdsourced elicitations for the narratives present the dataset. Notice that total elicitations, which are slightly more than narratives because some narratives have multiple elicitations. The average elicitations lengths, standard deviations and number of unique tokens are computed using Spacy NLP. Completions times are also reported for completeness, with the time required to read the guidelines before starting the task, the time to complete one elicitation and the overall total time. }
