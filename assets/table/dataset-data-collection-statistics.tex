\caption{Report of the statistics computed from the crowdsourced eliciting questions for the narratives present the corpus. Notice that the total eliciting questions are slightly more than narratives because some narratives have multiple eliciting questions. Completion times are also reported for completeness, with the time required to read the guidelines before starting the task, the time to complete one question and the overall total time. }
