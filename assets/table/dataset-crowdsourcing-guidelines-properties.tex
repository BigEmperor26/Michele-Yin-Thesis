% The main purpose of these guidelines was to help workers in producing a good elicitation. Our goals were for the elicitation to be questions with the following properties:
% \begin{itemize}
    
%  Focused on events of the narrative.
%  Suggested, but not enforced, focused on the highlighted portions of the narratives, i.e. parts of the narratives with valence.
%  Containing feedback signals, such as \emph{``Capisco"} or \emph{``Oh, che bello"} and other signs of active listening.
%  Centered around the narrator, i.e. should not move away from the narrator the focus of the story.
%  Containing explicit references to events that happened in the narrative.
%  Showing empathy to the narrator, for instance with words as \emph{``Mi dispiace"} when sad events are mentioned.
%  Short and on point.
%  Correct, both grammatically and syntactically.
% % \end{itemize}
% % On the other hand, we explicitly required our elicitation not to be any of the following:
% % \begin{itemize}
%  Questions on personal opinions.
%  Suggestions.
%  Hypothetical questions or scenarios.
%  Questions that move the focus of the conversation away from the narrator.
% % \end{itemize}
